# Release Skill

Release a new version of `slack-acp`.

## TL;DR

There's a script that does the whole thing:

```bash
.fir/skills/release/release.py            # auto-bump, no push
.fir/skills/release/release.py --push     # auto-bump + push to origin
.fir/skills/release/release.py --version 1.0.0 --push
.fir/skills/release/release.py --dry-run  # preview, mutate nothing
```

It runs `make all`, determines the bump from `## [Unreleased]` in
`CHANGELOG.md` (or accepts an explicit `--version`), rolls the
CHANGELOG, writes `VERSION`, commits, tags, `make install`s, and
verifies. Refuses to overwrite an existing tag. Stdlib-only Python
so it works on any Mac without setup.

The rest of this document explains the same flow manually, in case
the script needs to be edited or skipped step-by-step.

## Version determination

If the user provides a version, use it. Otherwise auto-determine:

1. Read the current version from `VERSION`.
2. Look at entries under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. If there are `### Added` or `### Removed` entries → **minor** bump
   (e.g. 0.1.0 → 0.2.0).
4. If there are only `### Fixed` or `### Changed` entries → **patch**
   bump (e.g. 0.1.0 → 0.1.1).
5. If the section is empty → ask the user whether to proceed or abort.

## Steps

1. **Full build & test** — execute `make all` (default target) and
   confirm everything passes: vet, test-race, 100% coverage gate (via
   `covgate`), all 5 cross-builds, native build, license check.
2. **Check CHANGELOG** — confirm there are entries under
   `## [Unreleased]`. If empty, ask the user.
3. **Determine version** — follow the rules above if the user didn't
   specify. State the version and proceed.
4. **Update CHANGELOG** — rename `## [Unreleased]` to
   `## [VERSION] - YYYY-MM-DD` (today's date) and add a fresh empty
   `## [Unreleased]` section above it. Reverse-chronological order.
5. **Update VERSION** — write the new version (single line, trailing
   newline).
6. **Commit** — check `git status` first. Stage all uncommitted
   changes with `git add -A`, then `git commit -m "release: vVERSION"`.
7. **Tag** — `git tag -a vVERSION -m "release: vVERSION"` (pass `-m`
   to avoid opening an editor).
8. **Install** — `make install` to put the new binary in `$GOBIN`.
9. **Verify** — `slack-acp --version` prints the new version.

## Important notes

- **Uncommitted changes**: always check `git status` before committing.
  All release-related and pending changes should be in the release
  commit.
- **Avoid interactive git**: pass `-m` to `git tag -a` and `git commit`.
  Git may try to open vim/nano, which fails non-interactively.
- **Moving tags**: if you need to move a tag after an extra commit,
  `git tag -d vVERSION` then re-create.
- **No published release pipeline yet** — slack-acp does not currently
  ship a GitHub Actions release workflow, GoReleaser config, or
  Homebrew tap. `make publish` only pushes `main` and the tag. Users
  install via `go install` or `make deploy`. If/when a release pipeline
  is added, update this skill.

## Publishing

After the user confirms, run `make publish`. This pushes `main` and
`vVERSION` to `origin`.

```bash
make publish
```

Currently this is a straight push. There is **no post-publish CI
workflow** to monitor — once the tag lands, users on the same machine
can `go install github.com/kfet/slack-acp/cmd/slack-acp@vVERSION` and
remote hosts can be upgraded with the `update` skill.

If any step fails, stop and report. Do not push or publish unless the
user confirms.

## Post-publish: notify hosts

If you know which hosts run slack-acp, follow up with the `update`
skill for each, or hand the list back to the user. There's no central
update mechanism yet.
