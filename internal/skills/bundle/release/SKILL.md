# Release Skill

Release a new version of `slack-acp`.

## Version determination

If the user provides a version, use it. Otherwise auto-determine:

1. Read the current version from `VERSION`.
2. Look at entries under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. If there are `### Added` or `### Removed` entries → **minor** bump
   (e.g. 0.1.0 → 0.2.0).
4. If there are only `### Fixed` or `### Changed` entries → **patch**
   bump (e.g. 0.1.0 → 0.1.1).
5. If the section is empty → ask the user whether to proceed or abort.

## Steps

1. **Full build & test** — execute `make all` (default target) and
   confirm everything passes: vet, test-race, 100% coverage gate (via
   `covgate`), all 5 cross-builds, native build, license check.
2. **Check CHANGELOG** — confirm there are entries under
   `## [Unreleased]`. If empty, ask the user.
3. **Determine version** — follow the rules above if the user didn't
   specify. State the version and proceed.
4. **Update CHANGELOG** — rename `## [Unreleased]` to
   `## [VERSION] - YYYY-MM-DD` (today's date) and add a fresh empty
   `## [Unreleased]` section above it. Reverse-chronological order.
5. **Update VERSION** — write the new version (single line, trailing
   newline).
6. **Commit** — check `git status` first. Stage all uncommitted
   changes with `git add -A`, then `git commit -m "release: vVERSION"`.
7. **Tag** — `git tag -a vVERSION -m "release: vVERSION"` (pass `-m`
   to avoid opening an editor).
8. **Install** — `make install` to put the new binary in `$GOBIN`.
9. **Verify** — `slack-acp --version` prints the new version.

## Important notes

- **Uncommitted changes**: always check `git status` before committing.
  All release-related and pending changes should be in the release
  commit.
- **Avoid interactive git**: pass `-m` to `git tag -a` and `git commit`.
  Git may try to open vim/nano, which fails non-interactively.
- **Moving tags**: if you need to move a tag after an extra commit,
  `git tag -d vVERSION` then re-create.
- **No PGO here.** Unlike fir, slack-acp does not use PGO, so
  `make publish` is a straight push — no amend dance.

## Publishing

After the user confirms, run `make publish`. This pushes `main` and
`vVERSION` to `origin`. The GitHub `release.yml` workflow then:

1. Runs `make all` (vet, race, coverage gate, cross-builds, license
   check).
2. Invokes GoReleaser: builds the 5 cross-compile targets, creates the
   GitHub release with binaries + checksums + `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`,
   and commits `Formula/slack-acp.rb` to `kfet/homebrew-ai` (the
   shared tap).

After which `brew install kfet/ai/slack-acp` (or `brew upgrade`) will
pick up the new version.

Alternatively, `make deploy HOST=<host>` pushes the right
cross-compiled binary directly to a remote host via scp (no GitHub
release needed) — useful for hotfixing a deployment.

If any step fails, stop and report. Do not push or publish unless the
user confirms.

## Post-publish: track GitHub Actions

After `make publish` succeeds, poll GitHub Actions until every
triggered workflow for the release commit finishes:

```bash
gh run list --limit 10 --json status,conclusion,name,headSha,createdAt,databaseId 2>&1
```

This must **not** use `--branch` filtering — tag-triggered workflows
(`release`) do not appear under a branch filter. Match runs by
`headSha` against the release commit SHA.

## Finish on the FLEET, not on one host

**A deploy is done when the fleet is converged, not when a host is.** This relay
is registered in the fleet registry (`poe-acp/bots/slack-two.json`) as a
**tracked** instance: the registry knows its host, unit and wanted version and
reports drift, but `converge.sh` will not deploy it — deploying is this repo's
job, above. Close every release/deploy/update with the read-only sweep:

```bash
cd ~/src/poe-acp && ./scripts/converge.sh status      # or: ssh miki 'cd ~/src/poe-acp && ./scripts/converge.sh status'
```

It reports every relay instance on every host — poe-acp, slack-acp and
zulip-acp — with wanted vs **running** version (read from the live process,
never the on-disk binary) and drift. Do not say "released" or "deployed" until
the `slack-two` row is `ok`. Paste the output into your reply.

After a release, also bump this relay's wanted version so the sweep tells the
truth: `poe-acp/dist.lock` → `.relays["slack-acp"]` (or run
`poe-acp/scripts/converge.sh --tot`, which re-resolves it from the latest tag),
and commit that.

Canonical note: `~/sync/shared/docs/notes/relays.md` (on a bot host:
`~/.local/state/poe-acp/notes/fleet/docs/notes/relays.md`).

### Two traps this sweep exists to catch

- **Never infer presence from a binary or a glob.** Every fleet host runs zsh,
  where `ls ~/.local/bin/*-acp` **aborts the whole command** when it matches
  nothing — and the empty output reads as "not installed". That is how a live
  `slack-acp` was declared absent. Ask the supervisor:
  `systemctl --user list-units --type=service --all --no-legend --plain | awk '$1 ~ /acp/'`
  or `launchctl list | awk '$3 ~ /acp/'`. Match the unit **name**, not the
  Description.
- **A repo can have two live clones and you will release from the stale one.**
  `git fetch origin`, then `git status -sb` and read *ahead/behind*, before you
  trust any clone. Release from the clone on the host that RUNS the relay —
  `kopitwo`. (2026-09-04: a `zulip-acp` release cut from the stale mikiserver
  clone produced two different v0.14.0s.)
